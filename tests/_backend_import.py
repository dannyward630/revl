"""Shared loader for backend emitter modules in tests.

Every backend directory ships its own ``emit.py``. A suite that does
``sys.path.insert(0, <backend>); import emit`` binds the CANONICAL name
``emit``, so two such suites running in ONE pytest process collide on
whoever got ``sys.modules['emit']`` first — one of them silently compares
its goldens against the wrong renderer (findings-map.md, post-final-run
addendum). Load by path under a unique module name instead; loaded
modules are cached in ``sys.modules`` so a combined run executes each
emitter exactly once.

Deliberate exception: tests/test_replay.py keeps the canonical names
``emit`` and ``runtime``: emitted modules do ``from runtime import ...``,
so an aliased copy would be a *different* module object and its trace
fixture would observe nothing. It reaches ``emit`` through
``revl._paths.python_backend_emitter()``, which imports the canonical name
and refuses one bound to another backend's file (issue #1449).
